# Super Store Dashboard - Dataking and Survey Limited Work Experience Program



## Introduction
Welcome to the Super Store Dashboard project! This project is part of my participation in the Dataking and Survey Limited Work Experience Program (WEP). The dashboard provides valuable insights into a fictional superstore's operations, including total transactions, product categories, shipping costs, regional sales, and more.


## Key Insight
The Dashboard revealed several significant insights about the  store. The following are some key findings:
- Total transactions and product category overview: Total Transactions:8399, Product Categories:3
- Shipping metrics: Average Days to Ship 2.03 days and Average Shipping Cost $12.84
- Sales trend analysis Overall trend shows a decline from 2009 to 2011, with a slight upturn in 2012
- Regional sales comparison: Ranked from highest being West and  lowest being Nunavut
- Shipping cost analysis by mode: Ranked from highest being Delivery Truck and lowest being Express Air
- Profitability of Product Category: Ranked from highest being Technology Product and lowest being Furniture
- Returned product analysis: Office Supplies being the most returned category followed by Technology and Furniture


## Recommendations
Based on the  information on the dashboard, the following recommendations can be made:
- Optimize shipping methods: The high cost of Delivery Trucks and Regular Air shipping suggests a potential for cost savings. Consider negotiating better rates with carriers or optimizing routes and Investigate why Express Air, despite being faster, has the lowest cost. If it's cost-effective, consider increasing its use.
- Focus on regional sales improvements: Analyse the success factors in the West and Ontario regions and apply those strategies to underperforming regions like Nunavut and Northwest Territories. Also, develop targeted marketing campaigns for Quebec and Atlantic regions to boost sales.
- Address declining sales trend: Investigate the reasons behind the sales decline from 2009 to 2011. and build on the slight upturn in 2012 by identifying and replicating successful strategies from that year.
- Enhance product category management: Technology is the most profitable category. Consider expanding this product line or applying its successful strategies to other categories and evaluate the furniture category to improve its profitability, possibly by adjusting pricing or product mix.
- Reduce return rates: Office Supplies have the highest number of returns. Investigate the reasons (quality issues, mismatched expectations) and address them to reduce returns. Also, implement a quality control process for all categories to minimize returns.
- Improve shipping efficiency: The average shipping time of 2.03 days is good, but there's room for improvement. Aim to reduce the upper range of 4.07 days.
- Balance product focus: While Technology is most profitable, ensure Office Supplies and Furniture aren't neglected, as they contribute to overall sales volume.
- Please refer to the Power BI dashboards and reports for detailed visualizations and further analysis of the dashboard.
